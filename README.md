# SurrealDB Client

This is **NOT** the official SurrealDB client. This is a client that I made for my own use. Anyone can use it for their own use, but I am not responsible for any damage that may occur ðŸ‘¹.

If you think that this client is missing something, please open an issue or a pull request, maybe I will at some point see it and do something about it ... or not ðŸ™ƒ.
